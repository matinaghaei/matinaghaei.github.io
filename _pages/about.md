I am a master’s student in Computer Science at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca), working on Reinforcement Learning theory from an optimization perspective. Specifically, my research has resulted in practical entropy-regularized policy gradient algorithms with proven convergence guarantees. The [paper](https://opt-ml.org/papers/2023/paper101.pdf) featuring my work was accepted for an oral presentation **(top-5% contribution)** in [the 2023 NeurIPS OPT Workshop](https://opt-ml.org/papers.html).

From 2017-2022, I studied for a bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en), which **ranks 2nd** among the country’s universities in computer sciences according to [the 2024 Times thematic ranking](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2024/subject-ranking/computer-science#!/length/25/locations/IRN/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats). I achieved straight A’s in all computer science courses, earning a **4 /4 major GPA**. My [BSc thesis](/bsc-thesis/) was a comparison between Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning algorithms for portfolio management.

In high school, I studied for [the Iranian National Olympiad in Informatics](https://ioinformatics.org/journal/v11si_2017_25_33.pdf), a series of exams assessing knowledge of mathematics, algorithms, and coding skills. I advanced to the 3rd stage of the Computer Olympiad, which **only 80 students** reached.

At **age 11**, I qualified as a member of [the National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Development_of_Exceptional_Talents), where I found my interest in coding and started developing C++ programs, fascinated by how fast computers can explore the solution space of mathematical problems.
