I am a master’s student in Computer Science at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca) with [Sharan Vaswani](https://vaswanis.github.io), working on Reinforcement Learning theory from an optimization perspective. Specifically, my research has resulted in practical entropy-regularized policy gradient algorithms with proven convergence guarantees. The papers featuring my work are accepted in [the NeurIPS Optimization for Machine Learning (OPT2023)](https://opt-ml.org/oldopt/opt23/), and in [the Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC 2024)](https://rl-conference.cc/2024/index.html). I am currently doing an internship at [Huawei Noah’s Arc Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk), working on LLM agents in the Embodied AI setting.

From 2017-2022, I studied for a bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en). My [BSc thesis](/bsc-thesis/) was a comparison between Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning algorithms for stock trading. In high school, I advanced to the 3rd stage of [the Iranian National Olympiad in Informatics](https://ioinformatics.org/journal/v11si_2017_25_33.pdf), which **only 80 students** reached. At **age 11**, I qualified as a member of [the National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Development_of_Exceptional_Talents), where I found my interest in programing, fascinated by how fast computers can explore the solution space of mathematical problems.
