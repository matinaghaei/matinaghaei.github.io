Matin was **only 11** when he qualified as a member of [the National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Development_of_Exceptional_Talents). 2 years later, he found his interest in coding and started developing C++ programs to solve mathematical problems. It was fascinating for him how fast computers can explore the solution space of a problem.

In high school, he studied for the Nationwide Student's Computer Olympiad—A series of exams assessing knowledge of mathematics and algorithms along with coding skills. In his first participation, Matin advanced to the 3rd stage of the Computer Olympiad—which **only 80 students** managed to reach.

After high school, he was admitted to the Computer Engineering program at [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en), one of Iran's best and oldest higher education technical and engineering institutes, which **ranks 2nd** among the country's universities in the field of computer sciences according to [the 2022 Times thematic ranking](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2022/subject-ranking/computer-science). With the help of his knowledge in algorithms and coding experience, Matin achieved straight A's in all computer science courses, resulting in **a 4 out of 4** major-related GPA. His [BSc thesis](/bsc-thesis/) is a comparison between actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms for portfolio management.
